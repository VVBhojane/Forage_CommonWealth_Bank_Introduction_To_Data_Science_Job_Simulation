# Forage_CommonWealth_Bank_Introduction_To_Data_Science_Job_Simulation

This Repository consist of all the PDF and Excel files of the tasks that were assigned during the CommonWealth Bank Introduction to Data Science Job Sim hosted on Forage.

****Task 1: Data Aggregation and Analysis: -****

**Tasks assigned: -**

Across locations, how many apples were purchased in cash?

How much total cash was spent on these apples?

Across all payment methods, how much money was spent at the Bakershire store location by non-member customers?

****Task 2: Data Anonymsation: -****

**Tasks Assigned: -**

We need you to anonymise this data to hide personal details while preserving any useful information for the data scientists at InsightSpark.

Here are some examples of how you may anonymise a data set:

You could remove columns that don’t provide helpful information for analysis (e.g., names or credit card numbers).

You could mask any columns that can identify an individual (e.g., passport numbers or mobile numbers).

You could categorise personal figures (e.g., age and income) into a bracket rather than a specific number.

****Task 3: Propose Data Analysis Approaches: -****

**Tasks Assigned: -**

Start by familiarising yourself with the “@CommBank Twitter Account” to see what information is publicly available.

When you’re comfortable with the Twitter interface, move forward and begin to look into the Twitter API.
 “Twitter API: Data Dictionary” will show you the types of information that you can scrape from Twitter automatically using a programming language like Python.
“Twitter: Build for Business,” on the other hand, will provide you with insights into how this information can be used in a business environment.

Once you’ve familiarised yourself with the referenced resources, write a proposal that suggests ways that InsightSpark can use the available data on the @CommBank Twitter account
to extract valuable insights.

****Task 4: Designing a Database: -****

**Tasks Assigned: -**

Propose a structured database for storing tweets from the CommBank Twitter account, replies, quote retweets, and direct mentions.

Define the tables, including the fields, primary keys, and relationships.
